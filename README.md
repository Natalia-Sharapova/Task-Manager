# Task-Manager

## Hello! This is an app where I trained my skills in creating tableViews, collectionViews, data entry interfaces and custom cells. 
## Here were used UIKit, MVC.

## This is an improvised application for registering a to do tasks into tableViews, embedded in collection view. 

## In this application, the appearance of the editing screen depends on the model, so if we change the model, the appearance of the screen changes after it

### Ð¢o use the application, you need to enter your registration data

### The name must consist only of letters and the password must contain at least 5 characters
### If the name and password do not match the ones you entered earlier, you will see a warning
